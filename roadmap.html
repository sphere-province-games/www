                                <p>Currently, our game is in the final process of our game development phase, called post-production. This stage involves finalizing and polishing the game before its release to ensure it meets quality standards and is ready for distribution. We make sure the game can run on the machines we want, make sure there are no bugs on release, and apply any polishing that needs to be done.</p>

From the book, we have implemented an agile development process that would last us for the rest of the school year, ensuring we follow all the steps of our roadmap.</p>
