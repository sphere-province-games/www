            <p><strong>ABOUT THE GAME<br></strong></p>
            <p><strong></strong>
                Created by the first Game Design and Development Capstone Team from Ball State, Mission Rovee got its start by following 
                Richard LeMarchand's 'A Playful Production Process' and was chosen as the game to pursue for the capstone project out of three distinct proposals.
                The initial vertical slice, (essentially a completed level meant to represent the full game), was reviewed by a board of industry professionals and was determined
                as the most viable game to pursue in the short amount of time we have.
