                            <p>MissionRovee is an alt-ctrl space game where your mission is to collect minerals for analysis and bring Rovee home! Communicate with Rovee as much as possible, telling her where to go and what to do, to ensure the best chance of survival! Keep in mind that Rovee has a limited amount of battery life, so if she dies, the mission is a failure!</p>

                            <p>The term refers to a video game that is played with non-traditional controls. Some traditional controls are well-known to gamers, such as keyboards, mice, gamepads, and touchscreens. But with this game, we use only the keyboard to operate a rover, as suuposed to using something like a joystick.</p>
